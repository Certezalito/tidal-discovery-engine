# Tidal Discovery Engine Constitution

## Core Principles

### User-Centricity
The project will prioritize a simple and intuitive command-line interface (CLI) that allows for easy configuration and operation.

### Automation
The core value lies in automating the process of finding new music and creating playlists, saving the user time and effort.

### Personalization
By starting with the user's favorite tracks, the generated playlists will be tailored to their specific musical tastes.

### Extensibility
The project will be built with a modular design to potentially accommodate other music services or recommendation engines in the future.

### Reliability
The application will be robust, with proper error handling and logging to ensure consistent and predictable behavior, especially when running as a scheduled task.

## Governance

Amendments to this constitution require a pull request and approval from the project owner.
